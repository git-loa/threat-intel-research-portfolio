Subject: Suspicious Job Posting — Potential Phishing Attempt

Hello,

I am reporting a suspicious job posting for the role of “Blockchain Analyst” under the employer name “Northgate Digital Asset Management Inc.” on your platform.

After applying, I received a message directing me to complete an interview through the domain:

    interiewca.icu

My analysis indicates the following:

• The domain was registered only recently (December 2025)  
• It uses a high‑risk TLD (.icu) commonly associated with phishing  
• The domain immediately redirects to an unrelated site (primaltech.it.com)  
• The redirect includes a custom tracking header, consistent with phishing kits  
• The website displays a QR‑based interview page with no branding or legitimate content  
• The supposed employer has no verifiable online presence, website, or corporate registration  

These indicators strongly suggest that this posting is part of a phishing campaign targeting job seekers.

For the safety of users on your platform, I recommend reviewing and removing the posting if confirmed malicious.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,  
Leonard Okyere Afeke
