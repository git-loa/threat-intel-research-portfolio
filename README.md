# **Threat Intelligence Research Portfolio**

Welcome to my **Threat Intelligence Research Portfolio**, a collection of independent investigations, OSINT analyses, and enrichment tooling built to demonstrate practical skills in threat hunting, phishing analysis, domain profiling, and infrastructure investigation.

This portfolio is designed to reflect the workflows used by real Threat Intelligence teams, including:

- Structured case studies  
- Evidence collection  
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping  
- Automation scripts  
- Reporting artifacts  
- Clear timelines and documentation  

All investigations are performed in a controlled lab environment using **Kali Linux**, OSINT tools, and custom Bash scripts.

## 🔍 **What You’ll Find Here**

### **1. Full Threat Intelligence Investigations**
Each investigation includes:

- Executive summary  
- Technical analysis (WHOIS, DNS, HTTP, sandboxing)  
- OSINT findings  
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping  
- Risk assessment  
- Timeline  
- Reporting artifacts  
- Raw evidence files  

This mirrors the structure used in professional TI reports.

---

### **2. OSINT & Enrichment Tooling**
Custom Bash scripts built on Kali Linux to automate:

- WHOIS lookups  
- DNS enumeration  
- HTTP header inspection  
- URLScan.io submissions  
- VirusTotal domain reputation checks  

These tools demonstrate automation skills essential for TI and SOC roles.

---

### **3. Real‑World Case Studies**
The portfolio begins with:

### ** interiewca-icu-phishing/**
A QR‑based phishing campaign impersonating a blockchain employer on a job platform.  
Includes:

- WHOIS evidence  
- DNS records  
- URLScan sandbox results  
- Timeline  
- MITRE mapping  
- Report to the job platform  
- Full case study  

More investigations will be added over time.
